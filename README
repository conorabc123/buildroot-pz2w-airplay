This buildroot tree is up to date as of 04/23/2025.

This is a buildroot set up for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. The image accomplishes the following:

Over a serial console (115200 baud. Looking for someone to test HDMI console), the Pi boots and prompts for a WiFi SSID/Passphrase.

It grabs a DHCP lease, sets up NTP to sync the clock, and then gets Docker ready.

Once Docker is ready, it pulls mikebrady/shairport-sync:latest and starts it using /dev/snd for output.

This allows a plug and play solution to turn your PZ2W into an airplay receiver. 

TODO:
Randomly generate root password and show on first boot (Or prompt user to set)
utilize wpa passphrase to stop storing PSK in plain text in wpa_supplicant.conf
allow user to set manual network configuration
after initial configuration, set rootfs to read only, and provide cli tool to change this for maintenance.


Below is the original README:

Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!

Buildroot comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards. Run
'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.

Please feed suggestions, bug reports, insults, and bribes back to the
buildroot mailing list: buildroot@buildroot.org
You can also find us on #buildroot on OFTC IRC.
